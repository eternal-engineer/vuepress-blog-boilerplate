## Chapter One - It's all about complexity

* The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating.
* Creating working software is expensive. Itâ€™s very much a cost and time optimisation game. More complex the software, the more time it takes and more expensive it becomes.
* Good designs are complexity reducers. They keep the complexity level in check.
* Two approaches to fight complexity
    * Eliminate complexity - remove special cases, consistent styling, etc.
    * Encapsulate complexity - so that we can work on a system without dealing with it's complexity  
* Software Design is not an upfront task we do. We have the ability, and we should continuously iterate and improve. 
* Incremental design also means continuous redesign
* The question to ask while making a design change is: Is the software less or more complex? Complexity is a very good measure of design. 


*meta*

*  waterfall couldn't incorporate execution time design decision because people who made design choices may have moved on to something else
* In agile, the initial design focuses on implementing a subset of the functionality. Then we revisit our choices, make fixes and make some more changes.
