## Chapter One - It's all about complexity

* The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating.
* Creating working software is expensive. Itâ€™s very much a cost and time optimisation game. More complex the software, the more time it takes and more expensive it becomes.
* Good designs are complexity reducers. They keep the complexity level in check.
* Two approaches to fight complexity
    * Eliminate complexity - remove special cases, consistent styling, etc.
    * Encapsulate complexity - so that we can work on a system without dealing with it's complexity  
* Software Design is not an upfront task we do. We have the ability, and we should continuously iterate and improve. 
* Incremental design also means continuous redesign
* The question to ask while making a design change is: Is the software less or more complex? Complexity is a very good measure of design. 


## Chapter Two - The nature of complexity

* Complexity is **anything** related to the **structure** of a software system that makes it hard to **understand and modify**
* Complexity is a point in time measure of the **piece** of code we are trying to understand or modify. for example, if a complex system is rarely used and doesn't need to be understood, it adds little value to the overall complexity
* Complexity is more apparent to readers :) 

**Symptoms of complexity**

* Change amplification - huge change radius for a visible small change.
* Cognitive Load - How much information do I need to know to complete a task. Too much information increases the chances of missing out on something crucial and hence bugs crop up. eg. global variables, API's with destructive side effects.
* Unknown Unknowns - not sure which piece of code to change for completing a task. This is a factor for every person who's new to the team


* One of the most import design goals is to make the system ***obvious***. Obvious systems reduce onboarding thereby reducing time, effort and money

**Causes of complexity**

Complexity is caused by two things - ***dependencies and obscurity***

**Dependencies**

* A *dependency* exist if a given piece of code cannot be understood in isolation.
* Too many dependencies lead to cascading changes which are harder to test and causes more bugs. Huge change amplification also causes high cognitive load

**Obscurity** 

* means unknowns. it happens when the important information is not obvious. for example, a variable with a very generic name that doesn't carry much useful information. example, time, date, etc.
* Hidden dependencies are also obscurities. Obscurities causes unknown unknowns


## Chapter Three - Tactical vs Strategic Programming

**Tactical Programming**

* short sighted
* increases complexity - introduces special cases, dependencies and obscurities one change at a time
* the current tactical implementation makes future tactical implementations harder. **Complexity is incrememntal!**

**Strategic Programming**

* *Most of the code in any system is written by extending the current system. Our jobs as system designers is to facilitate this*. 
* strategic programming is not to invest all the time upfront in design. Every change that goes through should improve the design or atleast not detoriate

## Chapter Four - Modules should be deep

**Modular Design** - design systems so that developers face only a fraction of the overall complexity at any given time

* Modules can take many forms - classes, subclasses, services, etc.
* The goal of modular design is to keep the dependencies between them minimal
* Understanding modules - Interface and Implementation. Interface is the *what* and Implementation is the *how*

Note:
A developer should not need to understand the implementations of modules. This also means that implementation should have minimal side effects. Side effects reduces readability and loosens the interface

**Interfaces**

Interface is the guide on how to use a module. The guide can be classified into two types - formal and informal. 

* Formal information are the method signatures and return types/values. They are checked and verified by the programming language. Either at run time or at compile time. 
* informal information is the information the developer needs to know in order to use the module appropriately. e.g. types of files allowed, number of files allowed, etc.

**Abstractions**

Abstraction is the simplified view of an identity. Interfaces are just abstractions. 

Simplification is tricky. You could add a lot of information but that results into increased cognitive load. Or, in order to give out less information, we might end up hiding something important to build a model of the entity. 

An abstraction that omits important details is a **false abstraction**

**Deep Modules**

powerful yet simple modules

A module might not have an interface at all. e.g. garbage collectors. Garbage collectors reduce the cognitive load of freeing up memory

**Shallow Modules**

one whose interface is complicated relative to the functionality it provides


*Providing choice is good, but interfaces should be designed to keep the common case as simple as possible*

*If an interface has many features, but most developers only need to be aware of a few of them, the effective complexity of that interface is just the complexity of the commonly used features.

## Chapter Five - Information Hiding (and Leakage)

- Information hiding is a way of achieving deep modules
- Information hiding helps in two ways
  - simplifies the interface into a more abstract view
  - makes it easier to evolve the system
- private variables with getters is not information hiding. The information should be completely unknown and irrelevant to the module user

### Information Leakage

If a piece of information is reflected in the interface for a module, then by definition it has been leaked

**Back Door Leakage**

Two or modules depend on a third common shared entity

_example_: A module for writing file and a module for reading files depend on the type of file system. If file system were to change, both the modules will need to change. Although both system hid the information but both will need to change if the file system changes. Hence, the file system is not abstracted out clearly by either modules

**On Large classes**

- Information Hiding can often be improved by making a class slightly longer
- A larger class also allows us to raise the level of interface. Since it has a lot of information to operate on, it can club it and provide it as a single view.

**Information hiding within a class**

- Design the private methods within a class so that each encapsulates some information or capability and hides it from the rest of the class
- Try to minimize the number of places where each instance variable is used. Instance variables are shared across methods and hence increase dependency
