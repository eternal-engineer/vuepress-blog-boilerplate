## Chapter One

* The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating.
* Creating working software is expensive. Itâ€™s very much a cost and time optimisation game. More complex the software, the more time it takes and more expensive it becomes.
* Good designs are complexity reducers. They keep the complexity level in check.
* Two approaches to fight complexity
    * Eliminate complexity - remove special cases, consistent styling, etc.
    * Encapsulate complexity - so that we can work on a system without dealing with it's complexity
