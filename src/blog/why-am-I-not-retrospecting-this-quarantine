## [Draft] Why Am I Not Thinking Back

* There is not one future and there is not one past. There are various versions of future. Each with it's own set of probablities (depending on what I do). Same is with past, it is the sum of probablities of me being able to recollect events. 
* You only remember very high level bits of information. That too the events that were emotionally charged. Not necessarily the important ones and hence there is no point taking decisions on this information
* Large retrospectives are useless for the same reasons I mentioned above. Retrospecitves are feedback cycles. Shorter the better. Huge beheviour change is hard. Behaviours are habits. Habit formation doesn't work big bang. 
* I find it stupid to think about past in general. I am only human and will only optimise for what I feel right now. This contemplation is just a futile exercise. I could come up with totally different things on a different day
* Thinking while not acting is just philosophy. It's like having a dataset and don't know what to optimise for. I'd rather start with something and see why I failed the last time. Just for that one thing. Not 100 others.
